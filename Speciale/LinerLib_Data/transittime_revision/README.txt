The demand files in this folder are a consequence of revising transit
times in an era, where slowsteaming is much more common. It is also a
result of liner shipping network design models operating with an
average speed and hence not being able to set individual voyage speeds
on a service in order to meet critical transittimes. 

The origin-destination pairs, quantity and revenue is identical to the
orginal demand files. For most of the origin-destination pairs the
transit time is also identical, but for some the transit time has been
revised.

The demand pairs that have been revised are the origin-destination pairs where a direct sailing at 14 knots average speed is not possible within the allowed transit times.

Below is the number of revised transit times for the given instances:
WAF   6 od pairs
Pacific 15 od pairs
WorldSmall 106 od pairs
EuropeAsia 32 od pairs
WorldLarge 112 od pairs

They have been revised accordign to current transit times found on the internet.
